Product:

Think of this as the Cursor or github copilot for browser.

I want to reply to a webpage and ask questions. I don't want to copy the context everytime to an LLM seperately.
I also want to have multiple webpages as a context and ask questions.

Intention:

This is for us to get exposure to how we can use LLMs as developers.

I don't think this would be viable as business model as it's not that hard for any foundational player to build.
