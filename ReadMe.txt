Product:

Think of this as the Cursor or github copilot for browser.

I want to reply to a webpage and ask questions. I don't want to copy the context everytime to an LLM seperately.
I also want to have multiple webpages as a context and ask questions.

Intention:

This is for us to get exposure to how we can use LLMs as developers.

This may not be viable as business model as it's not that hard for any foundational player to build.

There is already a thing called Emily AI chrome extension which seems to be doing the same thing. But that doesn't mean we should hang our boots. First thing it's not that popular, doesn't have a lot of features yet. Even if it does, we can still find our space. Like how cursor did with copilot along side.
